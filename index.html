          <h1>Advanced CSS Sprint Challenge</h1>
          <p>This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply
            them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS techniques using Responsive Design and
            Preprocessing. During this Sprint, you studied how to use the viewport meta tag, media queries, setting up
            a preprocessor, and advanced use of preprocessing techniques. In your challenge this week, you will
            demonstrate proficiency by updating a website that is missing content as well as adding mobile styling.</p>

            <p>This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply
